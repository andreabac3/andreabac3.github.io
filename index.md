# About

Hello, my name is Andrea BacciuðŸ‘‹, <br>
I am a PhD student in Natural Language Processing at the Sapienza University of Rome under the supervision of the Professor [Fabrizio Silvestri](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/fabriziosilvestri).<br>
My path in the doctorate was possible thanks to the research grant offered to the winners in the [National Artificial Intelligence Competition](https://www.phd-ai.it/).<br><br>
I currently work at the [SapienzaNLP](http://nlp.uniroma1.it/) research group, in which I do research on Semantic Role Labeling, Question Answering, and Cross-linguality.<br><br>
I recently graduated with honors in the master's degree in computer science at the Sapienza University of Rome, presenting a research work on Cross-lingual Semantic Role Labeling, which was published and awarded with the [Outstanding Long Paper](https://2021.naacl.org/blog/best-paper-awards/) at the NAACL 2021 conference.<br><br>
My passions are mainly related to computer science, such as Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and the design of large-scale systems.<br>
Afterward the PhD, I would like to be able to do a job that combines these interests.<br>
Also, after a day spent fighting with bugs, I love doing Calisthenics, a discipline that I have been practicing for several years.<br>
