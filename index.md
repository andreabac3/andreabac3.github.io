**Applied Scientist II @ Amazon · Ph.D. in NLP**

I am an Applied Scientist II at Amazon in Madrid. I am the science lead for Cross-lingual Customer Review Summarization and I work on LLM-as-a-Judge, specifically researching Uncertainty Estimation.

I hold a Ph.D. in NLP from Sapienza University of Rome, supervised by Professor [Fabrizio Silvestri](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/fabriziosilvestri). My work was recognized with the 🏆 NAACL 2021 Outstanding Long Paper Award.

My journey in NLP spans from classic TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT up to LLMs. Along the way, I have worked on a diverse range of tasks including Semantic Role Labeling, Semantic Parsing, Word Sense Disambiguation, Sequential Recommender Systems, and Graph Neural Networks.

**Interests:** Uncertainty Estimation · Information Retrieval · NLU
